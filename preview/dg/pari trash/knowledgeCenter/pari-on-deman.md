# Pari - Dynamic CSS Delivery System

## Overview

The objective of this system is to deliver a custom CSS file to each user, containing only the styles for the components present on the requested page. This will reduce the amount of unnecessary CSS loaded by the user's browser, improving page load times and overall user experience.

### Competitors

- **Tailwind CSS**: Offers a utility-first approach with a custom build step to remove unused styles.
- **Material-UI**: Component-based design with styles included only for used components.
- **Polymer Project**: Web Components-based approach for encapsulating styles with components.

### Potential Users

- Web developers looking for performance optimization.
- Organizations with large-scale, component-based projects.
- Developers using micro-frontend architectures.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Overall File Size**: Deliver only the necessary CSS, avoiding extra network payload.
2. **Improve Load Times**: Faster page rendering by minimizing the amount of CSS to be parsed.
3. **Maintainability**: Easy integration and maintenance for developers and the build system.

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture

- **Component-Based Design**: Structure CSS into individual components.
- **Build Tool Integration**: Utilize tools like Webpack for custom build processes.
- **Dynamic Server-Side Scripting**: Implement Node.js scripts that dynamically assemble and serve CSS based on the components needed.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Componentization**: Break down the CSS into smaller, reusable components.
2. **Minification and Bundling**: Each component's CSS is minified and bundled using a build tool.
3. **Server-Side Logic**: Develop a Node.js application to handle incoming requests and serve the necessary CSS.
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement both server and client-side caching mechanisms.
5. **Testing**: Rigorous testing to ensure the dynamic serving works across all browsers and devices.
6. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for developers to integrate the system into their workflow.

## Feasibility Study

### Challenges

- Custom build configuration for each developer's needs.
- Complex server-side logic to accurately determine required CSS.
- Potential issues with cache invalidation.

### Advantages

- Significantly reduced CSS file sizes.
- Improved performance and faster page load times.
- Better user experience with quicker rendering.

### Disadvantages

- Increased complexity in build and deployment processes.
- Requirement for additional tooling and developer training.

## Market Analysis

## Conclusion

The Dynamic CSS Delivery System aims to revolutionize how CSS is served by providing just the necessary styles required for a page. While the implementation is complex and may require a paradigm shift in the build and deployment processes, the performance benefits and user experience improvements present a compelling case for its adoption.
