## Prompt 1
- "I'm planning to build a CSS library with a strong focus on component isolation, where each component is self-contained and only shares a base theme file. Could you outline what essential variables should be included in this base theme file to ensure consistency across the library without having components rely on each other? Specifically, I'm interested in variables for colors, typography, spacing, etc, and any other foundational elements that such a theme file should standardize."

## Prompt 2 
In the process of establishing a responsive design system for our CSS library, we aim to determine the most effective CSS units (such as px, rem, em, etc.) to employ across our components. Could you provide guidance on:

Unit Selection: The application and differences between absolute and relative CSS units, including px, rem, em, %, vw, and vh.

Responsive Best Practices: Best practices for using these units within the context of responsive web design, especially for typography, layout grids, spacing (margins and padding), and media queries.

Accessibility Considerations: How the choice of units can impact accessibility, particularly for users who may need to adjust default text sizes or for those relying on screen readers.

Cross-Device Behavior: Insights into how these units operate across various devices and resolutions, ensuring a consistent experience from mobile phones to large desktop displays.

Practical Examples: Examples of how to apply these units within the theme to maintain scalability and responsiveness of the components.

Please include a section in the theme documentation that explains the rationale behind the chosen units to ensure that all developers working with our library have a clear understanding of our responsive design system.

## Prompt 3 
Utilizing the list of variable components you've identified, please create a prototype CSS theme file that consists solely of variable declarations. Ensure that the variables use appropriate CSS units to foster a responsive design system across our library. Your theme file should:

Provide Clear Guidance: Include comments that describe the intended use for each variable, establishing clear guidelines for other developers.

Responsive Units: Carefully choose CSS units that enhance the themeâ€™s responsiveness, such as rem for typography and percentage or viewport units for layout dimensions.

Accessibility: Factor in accessibility considerations, ensuring that the use of these units contributes to an accessible user experience.

Fallback Strategies: Where applicable, provide fallbacks for older browsers to ensure consistent experiences across all user bases.

Examples: Include a few examples demonstrating the application of these variables in typical CSS rules, which will serve as a practical reference.

Please document each variable's purpose and demonstrate how these variables maintain a scalable and responsive design within our components.

## Prompt 4 

With the foundational theme file variables established, please proceed to the development of the CSS theme file. This stage should involve:

Coding Practices: Utilize the established variables to write clean, maintainable, and scalable CSS. Implement the theme file in a sample component to demonstrate its application.

Testing and Validation: Conduct comprehensive testing of the theme file within a development environment. Validate the CSS against multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the theme file for performance, ensuring that styles do not cause unnecessary repaints or reflows and that the file size is minimized.

Version Control: Document the development process using version control, enabling clear tracking of changes and facilitating collaboration among team members.

Please provide a summary of your development process, along with any challenges faced and how they were resolved
## Prompt 5

- Please perform an in-depth review of the CSS theme file we have compiled, ensuring that it encompasses all the necessary variables and sub-variables required for a responsive, component-based CSS library. In your assessment, consider the following:

Variable Completeness: Verify that all essential variables for colors, typography, spacing, and other foundational elements are included. Suggest additions if any key variables are missing.

Consistency and Standards: Evaluate the naming conventions and unit usage for consistency and adherence to industry standards, adjusting where necessary to ensure uniformity across the theme.

Responsive and Accessible Design: Critically analyze whether the values assigned to these variables support a flexible and accessible design system. Ensure that the variables align with best practices for responsive web design and accessibility guidelines such as WCAG.

Practical Application: Test the theme file against a range of use cases to check its adaptability and practicality. Confirm that the variables provide the necessary flexibility for different component constructions and user interfaces.

Documentation Review: Examine the accompanying documentation and comments within the theme file to guarantee they are clear, instructive, and beneficial for developers implementing the system.

After your review, please offer any recommendations for improvements or adjustments to enhance the theme file's efficacy as the cornerstone and isolated component structure of our CSS library.
