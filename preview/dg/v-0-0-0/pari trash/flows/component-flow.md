### Prompt 1

I have created a CSS library focused on component isolation. Each component is self-contained and shares only a base theme file. Can you explain the benefits of this approach in frontend development?"

### Prompt 2

"Here's the theme file for my CSS library:

```Css
:root {
  /* Color Scheme */
  --primary-color: #fff; /* Main brand color */
  --secondary-color: #f6a35b; /* Secondary color for contrast */
  --accent-color: #eeeeee; /* Accent color for highlighting elements */
  --background-color: #ffffff; /* Default background color */
  --text-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84); /* Primary text color */
  --text-secondary-color: #767676; /* Secondary text color */
  --border-color: #e1e1e1; /* Default color for borders */
  --error-color: #ff0033; /* Color used for error messages and icons */
  --success-color: #28a745; /* Color used for success messages and icons */
  --warning-color: #ffc107; /* Color used for warnings and cautionary messages */
  --info-color: #17a2b8; /* Color used for informational messages */

  /* Typography */
  --font-family: "Inter", sans-serif; /* Primary font family */
  --font-size-root: 16px; /* Root font size (for rem calculations) */
  --font-size-base: 1rem; /* Base font size for regular text */
  --font-size-sm: 0.875rem; /* Small font size for less important text */
  --font-size-lg: 1.25rem; /* Large font size for headings */
  --font-size-xl: 1.5rem; /* Extra large font size for major headings */
  --line-height-base: 1.5; /* Default line height */
  --heading-font-family: "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; /* Font family for headings */

  /* Spacing */
  --spacing-xs: 0.25rem; /* Extra small spacing */
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem; /* Small spacing */
  --spacing-xm: 0.75rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem; /* Medium spacing (default for margins and paddings) */
  --spacing-lg: 1.5rem; /* Large spacing */
  --spacing-xl: 2rem; /* Extra large spacing */
  --spacing-xxl: 3rem; /* Extra extra large spacing */

  /* Borders and Radius */
  --border-width: 1px; /* Default border width */
  --border-style: solid; /* Default border style */
  --border-radius: 0.25rem; /* Default border radius for rounded corners */
  --border-radius-lg: 0.5rem; /* Larger border radius for elements like buttons, inputs */

  /* Box Shadows */
  --box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Default box shadow */
  --box-shadow-hover: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Box shadow for hover states */

  /* Transitions */
  --transition-default: all 0.3s ease; /* Default transition for hover effects and similar */

  /* Z-index */
  --zindex-dropdown: 1000; /* Z-index for dropdown menus */
  --zindex-sticky: 1020; /* Z-index for sticky elements */
  --zindex-fixed: 1030; /* Z-index for fixed elements */
  --zindex-modal-backdrop: 1040; /* Z-index for modal backdrops */
  --zindex-modal: 1050; /* Z-index for modals */
  --zindex-popover: 1060; /* Z-index for popovers */
  --zindex-tooltip: 1070; /* Z-index for tooltips */

  /* Responsive Breakpoints */
  --breakpoint-xs: 0; /* Extra small devices (portrait phones) */
  --breakpoint-sm: 576px; /* Small devices (landscape phones) */
  --breakpoint-md: 768px; /* Medium devices (tablets) */
  --breakpoint-lg: 992px; /* Large devices (desktops) */
  --breakpoint-xl: 1200px; /* Extra large devices (large desktops) */
}
```

Analyze it and explain how the defined variables and styles can be used to maintain consistency across different components."

### Prompt 3

"Given the focus on component isolation in my CSS library, what are the key principles I should follow when designing a [component name] component to ensure it aligns with the library's architecture?

- "Generate a detailed wireframe for a generic, responsive [component name] component that can be used in various applications. This component should include the following elements:

1. Main Structure: Outline the primary structure of the component, including its size and proportions relative to the rest of the page. Indicate the placement of the main interactive areas.

2. Sub-Components: Detail any sub-components that are part of the main component. Describe how these sub-components interact with each other and the main component. Include elements such as buttons, input fields, dropdown menus, or icons.

3. Interactivity Features: Describe the interactive features of the component. This should include hover effects, click events, transitions, or animations. Explain how these features contribute to the user experience and functionality of the component.

4. Responsive Design: Explain how the component should adapt to different screen sizes. Include considerations for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Describe how the layout, size, and interactivity might change across devices.

5. Accessibility Considerations: Incorporate accessibility features in the wireframe, ensuring that the component is usable and navigable for users with various disabilities. Include keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and ARIA roles where applicable.

6. Visual Aesthetics: While detailed design is not the focus of a wireframe, provide general guidelines on the aesthetic aspects, such as spacing, alignment, and potential color schemes that align with modern UI design principles.

7. User Interaction Flow: Briefly describe the user interaction flow within the component. How does a user interact with it from start to finish? Include any dynamic changes to the component based on user interaction.

### Prompt 4
Considering the detailed wireframe and guidelines provided for a responsive 'navbar' component, please produce the HTML, CSS, and any necessary JavaScript code. Ensure the code meets the following criteria:

Component Isolation: The 'navbar' should be entirely self-contained with no dependencies on external styles outside of the base theme file variables.

Scalability: Code should be written in a way that allows the 'navbar' component to be easily scaled or extended with additional features or sub-components in the future.

Responsive Design: Include the necessary media queries using the base theme breakpoints to ensure the 'navbar' adapts to various screen sizes, maintaining usability and design integrity.

Accessibility: Incorporate accessibility best practices, including semantic HTML, proper ARIA roles, and ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.

Interactivity: Use JavaScript sparingly to handle any dynamic aspects of the 'navbar', such as dropdowns or mobile menu toggling, ensuring that script is modular and does not interfere with other components.

Performance: Write CSS and JavaScript with performance in mind, avoiding unnecessary complexity that could lead to repaints, reflows, or delays in interactivity.

State Management: Code should anticipate and handle various states of 'navbar' items, such as active, hover, disabled, or expanded for dropdowns.

Consistency: Follow the established naming conventions and coding standards of the CSS library to maintain consistency across all components.

Comments and Documentation: Include comments within the code to document the structure and purpose of different sections, aiding future maintenance and scalability.

Testing: Provide guidelines for testing the 'navbar' across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and functionality.

Please generate the code for the 'navbar' component that aligns with the fundamental architecture of our CSS library, keeping in mind these key principles for a robust, maintainable, and consistent design

### Prompt 5
