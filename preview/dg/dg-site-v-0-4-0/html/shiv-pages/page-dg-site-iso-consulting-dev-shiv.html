          ISO certification is important because it is recognized worldwide as
          an accepted standard of quality. When companies can accurately
          document their systems, they can compare them against a recognized
          standard for improvement. Since ISO certification is a recognized
          standard, companies can use it to gauge and select the vendors or
          subcontractors they work with.
