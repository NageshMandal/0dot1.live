# In Freedom We Are Born, In Freedom We Shall Live

## Why Sia

From the moment we are born, each of us carries a unique genetic blueprint, a distinct combination of traits and potentials encoded in our DNA. Yet, despite this inherent individuality, many of us find ourselves surrounded by and drawn to templated productsâ€”standardized solutions that fail to reflect our unique needs and preferences. This paradox raises a compelling question: why, with such a vast capacity for uniqueness, do we often settle for one-size-fits-all products?
